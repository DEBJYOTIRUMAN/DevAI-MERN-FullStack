Run the following command on your device

1.  Go to the Client folder.
2.  Open the terminal and type "yarn" or "npm install" then press enter to install the node package.
3.  After finishing installation of the node package type "yarn dev" or "npm dev" then press enter to start the project on your device.
4. Wait up to 30 seconds because this can cause a response delay for the first request that comes in after a period of web service inactivity.
